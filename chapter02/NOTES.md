# C Fundamentals

## 2.1 Writing a Simple Program

### PROGRAM [Printing a Pun](pun.c)

### Compiling and Linking

Three steps:
1. Preprocessing -  the **preprocessor** obeys commands that begin with `#` (known as *directives*)
2. Compiling - the **compiler** translantes the program into machine instructions (object code)
3. Linking - the **linker** combines object code with any additional code needed i.e. code libraries(like `printf`)

### Integrated Development Environments

## 2.2 The General Form of a Simple Program

Three key langauge features:

1. directives
2. functions
