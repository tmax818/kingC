# C Fundamentals

## 2.1 Writing a Simple Program

### PROGRAM Printing a Pun

- [pun.c](./code/pun.c)

### Compiling and Linking

Three steps:
1. Preprocessing -  the **preprocessor** obeys commands that begin with `#` (known as *directives*)
2. Compiling - the **compiler** translantes the program into machine instructions (object code)
3. Linking - the **linker** combines object code with any additional code needed i.e. code libraries(like `printf`)

### Integrated Development Environments

## 2.2 The General Form of a Simple Program

Three key language features:

1. directives
2. functions
3. statements

### Directives

directive: 
- commands meant for the preprocessor
- begin with the `#` character


### Functions

> [Functions] are the building blocks from which programs are constructed. In fact, a C program is little more than a collection of functions.

> In C, a function is simply a series of statements that have been grouped together and given a name.

### Statements

> a statement is a command to be executed when the program runs.


### Printing Strings

- the old `printf`
