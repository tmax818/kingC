### Strengths

- Efficiency
- Portability
- Power
- Flexibility
- Standard Library
- Integration with UNIX


> C is particularly powerful in combination with UNIX(including the popular variant known as Linux). In fact, some UNIX tools assume that the user knows C.


### Weaknesses

- error-prone
- difficult to understand
- difficult to modify
### Effective Use of C

- Learn how to avoid C pitfalls.
- Use software tools to make programs more reliable.
- Take advantage of existing code libraries.
- Adopt a sensible set of coding conventions.
- Avoid *"tricks"* and overly complex code.
- Stick to the standard.
